        HopHub is a ride sharing platform that aims to simplify common arrival to events
        and thereby make the world a little bit better. No matter if you fill up your car,
        share a train ticket, arrive by bus, plan a bike tour or walk.

    create-event:
      title: Create an event
      text: |
        You create a new event and share the link with potential attendees.
        Only people with the link can see the event.
    add-offer:
      title: Add an offer
      text: |
        People that want to propose a ride can now add an offer. This works for free seats in
        a car as well for a common train ride, a bus trip, a bike tour or a walk.
        No login is required, only an email address. As soon as the email address is
        confirmed, the offer is shown on the website so others can see it.
    add-request:
      title: Add a request
      text: |
        People who are looking for a ride but don't see a matching offer yet
        can add a request. Also here, no login is required, only an email address.
    match:
      title: Get in touch
      text: |
        When two parties match, they can get in touch with each other using a form
        on the website. The email address of the person reaching out is used as the
        Reply-To address, so the recipient can reply directly for further coordination.
    cleanup:
      title: Leave no traces
      text: |
        Offers, requests and events that are no longer valid are automatically and permanently
        removed from the database.

    title: Create your own event
