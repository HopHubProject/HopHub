Hi,

Thanks a lot for using HopHub!

The event "<%= @event.name %>" has been confirmed and is now active.

Please share the following link with potential participants:

    <%= event_url(@event) %>

If you want to update or delete the event, please use the following link which is only accessible to you:

    <%= edit_event_url(@event, admin_token: @event.admin_token, locale: I18n.locale) %>

The event and all its offers and requests will automatically be deleted after the configured end date (<%= l @event.end_date, format: :long, locale: I18n.locale %>).

Happy sharing, you are awesome!


Kind regards from the HopHub platform.
