# v2

After the initial launch of the project, we have made several improvements and added new features based on user feedback. Here are the key changes:

- **Removed the map view**: The map view was removed to simplify the user interface and focus on the core functionality of the application. Several users found the location input through the map cumbersome and unnecessary.
- **Geonames API integration**: We have integrated the Geonames API to provide a simpler and more privacy-focused way to enter the locations for offers. This allows users to input locations based on a ZIP code only, without relying on a map.
- **Removed requests**: Initially users could enter requests for rides, which made the UX more complex. Based on user feedback, we have removed this feature to streamline the application and focus on the core functionality of offering rides.
- **Allow markdown in event descriptions**: Users can now use markdown syntax in event descriptions, allowing for better formatting and readability of the information provided.
